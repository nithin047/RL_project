## VoronoiEnv.py:
This file contains the environment definition for learning the Voronoi tessellation. The format followed is the same as the openAI gym environments, and more specifically, follows the [cartpole environment](https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/master/gym/envs/classic_control/cartpole.py) closely.
